That means that the app (iOS, Android, web) must be prepared to show messages at any time that the API responds with one in the info section.


### 6. Error Codes

The services use [HTTP Status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) to notify errors. The apps must use the **info section** of the services responses, to show error messages (message type "error"), using the **"message_title", "message"** keys data.

The HTTP Status codes use for this services are:

* 400 Bad Request
* 401 Unauthorized: This code means that user has no longer access to session required services, in case of a session expired or is invalid, the services will return this error code and the app must delete the local session and send the user to the login section. If user try to open a session (login) but the credentials are invalid the services will return this error code.
* 403 Forbidden
* 404 Not Found
* 500 Internal Server Error
